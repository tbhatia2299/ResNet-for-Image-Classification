# ResNet-for-Image-Classification

The architecture is based on 50 layer sample from

Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun - Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (2015). 

Architecture.png is the snippet from the paper Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition(2015) on which this model is based.
